The Council noted the need to extend the mandate of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2016, given the prevailing conditions on the island.\n\nThe Council welcomed progress in negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders, who have expressed commitment to reach a comprehensive settlement as soon as possible. It recalled the importance of a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\nThe Council encouraged the sides to intensify substantive negotiations on core issues, stressing that the status quo is unsustainable. It called for renewed efforts on confidence-building measures, including military measures, and urged the opening of other crossing points along the Green Line.\n\nThe Council also highlighted the importance of public support for a settlement, urging leaders to foster positive rhetoric and explain the benefits of a settlement to both communities.
