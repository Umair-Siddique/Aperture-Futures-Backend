  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Mali, adopted Resolution 2308 (2016) on September 14, 2016. The Council welcomed progress toward sustaining peace, security, and stability in Liberia, commending the Government of Liberia, particularly the Liberia National Police, Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and Armed Forces of Liberia, for assuming security responsibility from the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). \n\nThe Council stressed that lasting stability requires well-functioning, accountable, and responsive national institutions, expressing concern that the Government of Liberia has not demonstrated sufficient progress. It noted with concern potential conflicts over natural resources, land ownership disputes, and corruption threats.\n\nThe Council encouraged inclusive and peaceful elections in Liberia, stressing that the Liberian authorities are responsible for the conduct and security of free, fair, and transparent elections in 2017. \n\nDetermining that the situation in Liberia continues to threaten international peace and security, the Council:\n\n1. Extended UNMIL's mandate until December 31, 2016;\n2. Maintained UNMIL's military and police component ceilings at 1,240 and 606 personnel;\n3. Affirmed readiness to consider UNMIL's withdrawal and a future United Nations presence, pending a review by December 15, 2016, and an assessment mission by November 15, 2016;\n4. Decided to remain seized of the matter.",
