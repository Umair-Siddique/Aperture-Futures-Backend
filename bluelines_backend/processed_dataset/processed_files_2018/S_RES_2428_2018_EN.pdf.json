Under Malong's leadership, the SPLA launched attacks on civilians, killing unarmed and fleeing civilians, and intentionally targeted schools and hospitals. In the Yei area, 114 civilians were killed by the SPLA and its allied forces between July 2016 and January 2017. Malong allegedly ordered the SPLA to clear civilians from the area around Wau in April 2017 and reportedly did not discourage the killing of civilians by SPLA troops. Malong was also responsible for the mass mobilization of Mathiang Anyoor Dinka tribal militia, which used child soldiers. Under Malong's leadership, the SPLA restricted access to UNMISS, JMEC, and CTSAMM when they tried to investigate and document abuses, including turning back a joint UN and CTSAMM patrol on April 5, 2017.",
