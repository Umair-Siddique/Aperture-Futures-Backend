The Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for one year without amendment, as requested by the Lebanese Government. The Council welcomed progress towards reactivation of Lebanese state institutions and the holding of legislative elections, and called for the formation of a new Lebanese Government without delay. It reiterated its support for Lebanon's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. The Council expressed concern at limited progress in implementing resolution 1701 (2006), and called on parties to strengthen efforts to fully implement the resolution. It also expressed deep concern at violations of the cessation of hostilities and underlined the risk of a new conflict. The Council urged parties to sustain the cessation of hostilities, exercise maximum calm and restraint, and refrain from actions or rhetoric that could jeopardize the cessation of hostilities. It emphasized the importance of full compliance with the prohibition on sales and supply of arms and related materiel. The Council condemned attempts to threaten Lebanon's security and stability, and reaffirmed its determination to ensure that no such acts prevent UNIFIL from implementing its mandate.
