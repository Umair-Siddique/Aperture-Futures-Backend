  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on the situation in Liberia and the subregion, commends the Government of Liberia for responding effectively to the Ebola outbreak and recognizes the resilience of the people and Government of Liberia. The Council welcomes efforts of Member States, bilateral partners, and multilateral organizations in supporting the Government of Liberia. \n\nThe Council endorses the Secretary-General's recommendation on the drawdown of UNMIL uniformed personnel and authorizes the Secretary-General to implement the third phase of the phased drawdown, reaching a new military ceiling of 3,590 personnel and a police ceiling of 1,515 personnel by September 2015. \n\nThe Council decides that the mandate of UNMIL shall no longer include a specific task, expects the Government of Liberia to assume full security responsibilities from UNMIL by 30 June 2016, and requests the Secretary-General to streamline UNMIL's activities. \n\nThe Council calls on the Governments of Liberia and CÃ´te d'Ivoire to reinforce cooperation, particularly in the border area, and reaffirms the importance of inter-mission cooperation arrangements as UNMIL and UNOCI downsize. \n\nThe Council decides to remain seized of the matter.",
