  "summary": "**OTHER ASPECTS OF ENRICHMENT**\n\n* Iran will abide by its voluntary commitments as expressed in its long-term enrichment and enrichment R&D plan.\n* The IAEA will confirm annually that Iran's enrichment and enrichment R&D activities are in line with this plan.\n\n**URANIUM STOCKS AND FUELS**\n\n* Iran will maintain a total enriched uranium stockpile of no more than 300 kg of up to 3.67% enriched uranium hexafluoride for 15 years.\n* Excess enriched uranium will be down-blended to natural uranium level or sold on the international market.\nHere is a summarized version of the document:\n\n**Section on Uranium Stockpile and Fuel Fabrication**\n\n* Iran will sell its excess enriched uranium stockpile (>300 kg UF6) to an entity outside Iran in exchange for natural uranium.\n* The E3/EU+3 will facilitate this contract.\n* Iran may also sell excess enriched uranium to the IAEA fuel bank in Kazakhstan.\n* Uranium oxide enriched to 5-20% will be fabricated into fuel plates for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) or transferred outside Iran.\n* Scrap oxide and other forms will be transferred outside Iran or diluted to 3.67% or less.\n\n**Fuel Fabrication and Stockpile Limits**\n\n* Russian-designed fuel assemblies for Russian-supplied reactors in Iran will not count against the 300 kg UF6 stockpile limit.\n* Enriched uranium in fabricated fuel assemblies from other sources will not count against the limit if certified by the fuel supplier and Iranian authority.\n* A Technical Working Group will establish criteria for assessing whether fabricated fuel can be readily converted to UF6.\n\n**Fuel Supply for TRR and Enriched Uranium Targets**\n\n* Iran will seek a commercial contract for fuel for the TRR and enriched uranium targets.\n* If no contract is concluded, the E3/EU+3 will supply 19.75% enriched uranium oxide (U3O8) in increments.\n\n**Centrifuge Manufacturing**\n\n* Iran will only produce centrifuges to meet enrichment and R&D requirements.\n* Iran will use stored IR-1 centrifuge machines to replace failed or damaged machines.\n* Iran will manufacture IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges without rotors from year 8-10.\n\n**Additional Protocol and Modified Code 3.1**\n\n* Iran will notify the IAEA of provisional application of the Additional Protocol and seek ratification.\n* Iran will implement the Modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangement to its Safeguards Agreement.\nHere is a summarized version of the document:\n\n**Past and Present Issues of Concern**",
