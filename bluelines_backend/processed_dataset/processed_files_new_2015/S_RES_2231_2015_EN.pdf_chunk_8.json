  "summary": "**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**\n\nThe implementation of JCPOA commitments will follow a sequence with specific milestones:\n\n* **Finalisation Day**: Negotiations conclude, and the resolution endorsing JCPOA is submitted to the UN Security Council.\n* **Adoption Day**: 90 days after endorsement by the UN Security Council, JCPOA comes into effect, and participants make arrangements for implementation.\n* **Implementation Day**: IAEA verifies Iran's nuclear-related measures, EU and US take actions, and UN-level actions occur.\n* **Transition Day**: 8 years after Adoption Day or when IAEA submits a report, EU and US take actions, and Iran seeks ratification of the Additional Protocol.\n* **UN Security Council resolution Termination Day**: 10 years from Adoption Day, UN Security Council resolution terminates.\n\n**DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM**\n\nIf a participant believes another is not meeting commitments:\n\n* The issue is referred to the Joint Commission for resolution within 15 days.\n* If unresolved, the issue is referred to Ministers of Foreign Affairs for 15 days.\n* An Advisory Board provides a non-binding opinion within 15 days.\n* If still unresolved, the complaining participant can cease performing commitments and/or notify the UN Security Council.\n* The UN Security Council votes on a resolution to continue sanctions lifting within 30 days of notification.\n* If the resolution is not adopted, previous UN Security Council resolutions are re-imposed, but not with retroactive effect on contracts signed prior to the date of application.\nHere is a summarized version of the document:\n\n**JCPOA Annex I – Nuclear-related measures**\n\n**A. General**\n\n1. The sequence of implementation of commitments is specified in Annex V. Unless otherwise specified, durations of commitments are from Implementation Day.\n\n**B. Arak Heavy Water Research Reactor**\n\n2. Iran will modernize the Arak heavy water research reactor to support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotopes production. The reactor will be redesigned and rebuilt based on an agreed conceptual design to minimize plutonium production and not produce weapon-grade plutonium. The power will not exceed 20 MWth.\n\n3. Iran will not pursue construction of the existing unfinished reactor based on its original design and will remove and make inoperable the existing calandria. Iran will maximize the use of existing infrastructure.",
