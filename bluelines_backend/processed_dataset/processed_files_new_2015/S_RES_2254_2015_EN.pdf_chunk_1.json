  "summary": "Here is a clear and concise summary of the Security Council document:\n\nThe Security Council:\n\nRecalling previous resolutions and statements on Syria, reaffirms its commitment to Syria's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.\n\nExpressing concern at the suffering of the Syrian people, the humanitarian situation, and the impact of terrorism, it demands that all parties protect civilians and stresses the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities.\n\nReiterating that a sustainable solution to the crisis is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, it encourages diplomatic efforts of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG).\n\nCommending the ISSG's commitment to a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition, it urges all parties to adhere to the principles identified by the ISSG.\n\nThe Council:\n\n1. Reconfirms its endorsement of the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012 and endorses the \"Vienna Statements\" as the basis for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition.\n\n2. Requests the Secretary-General to convene representatives of the Syrian government and opposition for formal negotiations on a political transition process, aiming to start talks by early January 2016.\n\n3. Acknowledges the role of the ISSG in facilitating the UN's efforts to achieve a lasting political settlement.\n\n4. Expresses support for a Syrian-led political process facilitated by the UN, aiming to establish credible, inclusive governance within six months, and free and fair elections within 18 months, under UN supervision.\nHere is a summarized version of the Security Council document 2254 (2015):\n\n5. Acknowledges the linkage between a ceasefire and a parallel political process, pursuant to the 2012 Geneva Communiqué, and supports a nationwide ceasefire in Syria to come into effect as soon as initial steps towards a political transition under UN auspices begin.\n\n6. Requests the Secretary-General to lead efforts to determine ceasefire modalities and requirements, and urges Member States, particularly ISSG members, to support and accelerate ceasefire efforts.\n\n7. Emphasizes the need for a ceasefire monitoring, verification, and reporting mechanism, and requests the Secretary-General to report on options within one month.\n\n8. Reiterates its call to prevent and suppress terrorist acts by ISIL, Al-Nusra Front, and other associated groups, and notes that the ceasefire will not apply to actions against these groups.",
