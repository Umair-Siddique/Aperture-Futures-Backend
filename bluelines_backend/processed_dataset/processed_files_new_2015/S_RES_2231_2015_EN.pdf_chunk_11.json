  "summary": "**CENTRIFUGES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**\n\n* Iran will conduct enrichment R&D without accumulating enriched uranium (para. 32).\n* For 10 years, Iran's enrichment R&D with uranium will only include IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and IR-8 centrifuges (para. 32).\n* Specific testing and storage requirements are outlined for various centrifuge types (paras. 33-41).\n* Iran will adapt PFEP to R&D activities and remove excess centrifuges and infrastructure (para. 41).\n* For 15 years, Iran will conduct all testing of centrifuges with uranium only at the PFEP and mechanical testing only at the PFEP and Tehran Research Centre (para. 40).\n\n**ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS**\n\n* The IAEA will confirm the failed or damaged status of centrifuge machines (para. 30).\n* For 15 years, Iran will install gas centrifuge machines or enrichment-related infrastructure only at specified locations and for specified activities (para. 31).\n* Iran intends to continue R&D on new types of centrifuges through computer modelling and simulations (para. 43).\nHere is a summarized version of the document:\n\n**FORDOW FUEL ENRICHMENT PLANT (FFEP)**\n\n* The FFEP will be converted into a nuclear, physics, and technology centre with international collaboration in agreed areas of research.\n* Iran will not conduct uranium enrichment or related R&D and will have no nuclear material at FFEP for 15 years.\n* For 15 years, Iran will maintain no more than 1044 IR-1 centrifuge machines at one wing of the FFEP.\n* Two cascades will be modified for stable isotope production in joint partnership with Russia.\n* Four cascades will be placed in an idle state, not spinning.\n* Excess centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed and stored at Natanz under IAEA continuous monitoring.\n\n**STABLE ISOTOPE PRODUCTION**\n\n* Iran will limit stable isotope production activities with gas centrifuges to FFEP for 15 years using no more than 348 IR-1 centrifuges.\n* Associated R&D activities will occur at FFEP and Iran's declared and monitored centrifuge manufacturing facilities.\n\n**IAEA MONITORING**\n\n* The IAEA will establish a baseline for uranium legacy from past enrichment operations at FFEP.\n* Iran will permit regular IAEA access, including daily access, to monitor stable isotope production and absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities at FFEP for 15 years.\n\n**OTHER ASPECTS OF ENRICHMENT**",
