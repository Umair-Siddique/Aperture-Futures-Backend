  "summary": "**Other Reactors**\n\n* 16. Iran will rely only on light water for its future nuclear power and research reactors with enhanced international cooperation.\n* 17. Iran intends to ship out all spent fuel for all future and present nuclear power and research reactors for further treatment or disposition.\n\n**Spent Fuel Reprocessing Activities**\n\n* 18. For 15 years, Iran will not engage in spent fuel reprocessing or spent fuel reprocessing R&D activities.\n* 19. For 15 years, Iran will not reprocess spent fuel except for irradiated enriched uranium targets for production of radio-isotopes for medical and peaceful industrial purposes.\n* 20. For 15 years, Iran will not develop, acquire or build facilities capable of separation of plutonium, uranium or neptunium from spent fuel or from fertile targets.\n* 21. For 15 years, Iran will only develop, acquire, build, or operate hot cells with specific dimensions and specifications.\n* 22. The E3/EU+3 are ready to facilitate examinations on fuel elements and/or fuel assembly prototypes.\n* 23. For 15 years, Iran will undertake non-destructive post irradiation examination (PIE) of fuel pins, fuel assembly prototypes and structural materials at the Arak research reactor complex.\n* 24. For 15 years, Iran will not engage in producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals or their alloys.\n* 25. Iran will not produce, seek, or acquire separated plutonium, highly enriched uranium, or uranium-233, or neptunium-237 for 15 years.\n* 26. If Iran seeks to initiate R&D on uranium metal based TRR fuel, it will present its plan to and seek approval by the Joint Commission.\nHere is a summarized version of the document:\n\n**ENRICHMENT CAPACITY**\n\n* Iran will maintain its enrichment capacity at no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuge machines in 30 cascades at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) for 10 years (para. 27).\n* Iran will limit uranium enrichment to up to 3.67 percent for 15 years (para. 28).\n* Excess centrifuges and infrastructure will be stored at Natanz in Hall B of FEP under IAEA continuous monitoring (para. 29).\n\n**CENTRIFUGES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**",
