  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Liberia and West Africa, adopted Resolution 1532 (2004) on 12 March 2004. The Council expressed concern that former Liberian President Charles Taylor and others have misappropriated Liberian funds and property, undermining the country's transition to democracy.\n\nThe Council determined that this situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security in West Africa and, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, decided to:\n\n1. Freeze funds, financial assets, and economic resources owned or controlled by Charles Taylor, his family members, senior officials of the former Taylor regime, and other close allies or associates designated by the Committee established by resolution 1521 (2003).\n\n2. Exempt from the freeze:\n(a) funds necessary for basic expenses, with notification to the Committee;\n(b) funds necessary for extraordinary expenses, approved by the Committee; and\n(c) funds subject to a judicial lien or judgement.\n\n3. Allow addition to frozen accounts of:\n(a) interest and other earnings; and\n(b) payments due under contracts or obligations that arose prior to the date of the resolution.\n\n4. Request the Committee to:\n(a) identify individuals and entities subject to the freeze and circulate a list to all States.\nThe Security Council:\n\n* Decides the Committee shall maintain and review every 6 months a list of individuals and entities subject to measures, \n* Assist States in tracing and freezing funds, assets and resources of listed individuals and entities,\n* Seek from all States information on actions taken to trace and freeze such funds, assets and resources.\n\nDecides to review measures at least once a year, first review by 22 December 2004.\n\nExpresses intention to consider making available frozen funds to the Government of Liberia once transparent accounting and auditing mechanisms are established.\n\nDecides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
