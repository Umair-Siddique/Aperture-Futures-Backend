  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions, particularly 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), affirms a vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side within secure borders. It expresses grave concern at ongoing violence since September 2000, stressing the need to ensure civilian safety and respect international humanitarian law. Welcoming diplomatic efforts, it demands an immediate cessation of all acts of violence, including terror, provocation, incitement, and destruction. The Council calls on Israeli and Palestinian sides to cooperate with the Tenet work plan and Mitchell Report recommendations to resume negotiations. It expresses support for efforts to halt violence and resume the peace process and decides to remain seized of the matter.",
