The Council notes the report of the Secretary-General and the reports of the UN Group of Experts on Côte d'Ivoire, and emphasizes the continued contribution to Côte d'Ivoire's stability of the measures imposed by resolutions 1572 (2004) and 1643 (2005).\n\nThe Council determines that the situation in Côte d'Ivoire continues to pose a threat to international peace and security in the region and, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, decides to:\n\n1. Renew until 31 October 2010 the measures on arms and financial and travel measures imposed by paragraphs 7 to 12 of resolution 1572 (2004) and the measures preventing the importation of rough diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire imposed by paragraph 6 of resolution 1643 (2005);\n\n2. Review these measures in light of progress achieved in the electoral process and the implementation of the key steps of the peace process by the end of the period mentioned in paragraph 1, and to carry out a review no later than three months after the holding of open, free, fair and transparent presidential elections or a midterm review no later than 30 April 2010;\n\n3. Call upon the Ivorian parties and all States to fully implement these measures and calls upon the UN Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) and the French forces to bring their full support to the implementation of the measures on arms;\n\n4. Demand that the Ivorian authorities take measures to put an immediate end to any violation of the measures imposed by paragraph 11 of resolution 1572 (2004);\n\n5. Demand that the Ivorian parties provide unhindered access to the Group of Experts and UNOCI;\n\n6. Reiterates that any threat to the electoral process, in particular any attack or obstruction of the action of the Independent Electoral Commission, shall constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process;\n\n7. Reiterates that any serious obstacle to the freedom of movement of UNOCI or the French forces, or any attack or obstruction of their action, shall constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process.\nHere is a concise summary of the Security Council document:",
