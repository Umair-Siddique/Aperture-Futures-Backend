HMX (Cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine)\n\t2. Hexanitrostilbene (HNS)\n\t3. Triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB)\n\t4. Triaminoguanidinenitrate (TAGN)\n\t5. Dinitroglycoluril (DNGU, DINGU)\n\t6. Tetranitrobenzotriazolobenzotriazole (TACOT)\n\t7. Diaminohexanitrobiphenyl (DIPAM)\n\t8. Picrylaminodinitropyridine (PYX)\n\t9. 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO or ONTA)\n\t10. Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX)\n\t11. 2-(5-cyanotetrazolato) penta amine-cobalt (III) -perchlorate (CP)\n\t12. cis-bis (5-nitrotetrazolato) tetra amine-cobalt (III) perchlorate (BNCP)\n\t13-20. Various other energetic materials\n\t21. Explosives with detonation velocity > 8,700 m/s or pressure > 34 GPa\n\t22. Organic explosives with detonation pressures ≥ 25 GPa and stable at ≥ 523 K\n\t23-24. Specific UN Class 1.1 and 1.3 solid propellants with high theoretical specific impulse\n\n**Note**: Energetic materials not part of a charge or device for civil projects are considered military items subject to UNSCR 687, para. 24.\nThe document outlines specific equipment and technologies subject to certain restrictions. \n\nThe equipment includes: \n- Specialized vibration test equipment capable of simulating flight conditions of less than 15,000 meters, along with associated software and technology for its development or production.\n\n- Specialized semiconductor manufacturing equipment for producing devices with a minimum feature size of 1.0 micrometers, including:\n  - Equipment for plasma etch, CVD, lithography, and more.\n  - Ion implantation equipment with beam energy exceeding 200 keV or optimized for less than 10 keV.\n  - Surface finishing equipment for semiconductor wafers.\n  - CAD equipment for semiconductor design.\n  - Equipment for assembling integrated circuits.\n\n- Certain biological equipment, specifically for the microencapsulation of live microorganisms and toxins in particle sizes of 1-15 microns.",
