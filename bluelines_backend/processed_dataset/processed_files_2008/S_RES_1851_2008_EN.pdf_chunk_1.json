  "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the Security Council document:\n\nThe Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on Somalia, expresses grave concern over the surge in piracy and armed robbery at sea off Somalia's coast, threatening humanitarian aid and international shipping. The Council reaffirms its respect for Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and emphasizes that international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), applies to combating piracy.\n\nThe Council notes the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) requests for international assistance to counter piracy and welcomes efforts by the EU, NATO, and other states to suppress piracy. It also welcomes initiatives to address the root causes of piracy and emphasizes the need for coordination among counter-piracy operations.\n\nThe Council expresses concern that the lack of capacity, legislation, and clarity on disposing of captured pirates has hindered international action. It reiterates that the 1988 SUA Convention provides a framework for prosecuting pirates.\n\nDetermining that piracy off Somalia's coast exacerbates the situation, which continues to threaten international peace and security, the Council:\n\n1. Condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed robbery against vessels off Somalia's coast;\n2. Calls on states and organizations to actively participate in the fight against piracy, deploying naval vessels and military aircraft, and seizing and disposing of pirate vessels and equipment;\n3. Invites states and organizations to conclude agreements with countries willing to take custody of pirates, allowing for the embarkation of law enforcement officials (\"shipriders\") to facilitate investigation and prosecution, with the TFG's consent.\nHere is a concise summary of the Security Council document 1851 (2008):\n\nThe Security Council:\n\n1. Encourages states to cooperate with Somalia in combating piracy and armed robbery at sea.\n\n2. Requests states to establish an international cooperation mechanism to combat piracy.\n\n3. Encourages creation of a regional centre to coordinate information on piracy.\n\n4. Authorizes states to undertake measures to suppress piracy in Somalia for 12 months.\n\n5. Calls on states to assist Somalia in strengthening its capacity to bring pirates to justice.\n\n6. Welcomes the communiqu√© of the International Conference on Piracy around Somalia.",
