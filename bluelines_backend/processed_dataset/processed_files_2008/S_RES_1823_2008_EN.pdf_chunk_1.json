  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adopted resolution 1823 (2008) on 10 July 2008. The Council considered reports on Rwanda and stressed the importance of cooperation from states in the region with the Security Council Committee concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Group of Experts. It also emphasized the need for states to prevent diversion of arms to illegal armed groups. Recalling recent agreements and conferences aimed at restoring peace in the Great Lakes region, the Council welcomed progress and called for full implementation. Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, the Council decided to terminate prohibitions imposed by paragraphs 9 and 10 of resolution 1011 (1995) and to dissolve the Committee established pursuant to resolution 918 (1994) concerning Rwanda.",
