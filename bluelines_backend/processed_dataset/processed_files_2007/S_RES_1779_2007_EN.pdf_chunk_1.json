It deplores ongoing violence, impunity, and humanitarian deterioration in Darfur, demanding an end to aerial bombings and military action. The Council commends efforts of the African Union, the Secretary-General, and regional leaders, and supports the AU/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the political process under AU/UN mediation.\n\nThe Council extends the mandate of the Panel of Experts until 15 October 2008, requesting a midterm briefing by 29 March 2008, and an interim report within 90 days, and a final report 30 days prior to the mandate's end. The Panel is to coordinate with AMIS, UNAMID, and international efforts, assessing progress on reducing violations and impediments to the political process.\n\nThe Council urges States, UN bodies, the African Union, and other parties to cooperate fully with the Committee and the Panel of Experts, and decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
