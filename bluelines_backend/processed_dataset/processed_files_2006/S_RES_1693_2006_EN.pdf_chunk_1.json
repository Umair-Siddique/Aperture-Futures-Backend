  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), reaffirms its commitment to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Council notes the upcoming elections on 30 July 2006 and stresses their importance for peace, stability, and national reconciliation. \n\nIt extends the increase in the military and civilian police strength of the UN Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) until 30 September 2006, with the understanding that this increase is temporary and will be downsized or repatriated by that date if no longer necessary for the electoral process.\n\nThe Council calls on the Transitional institutions and Congolese parties to ensure free, fair, and peaceful elections, respect the electoral timetable, and guarantee the security of the electoral process. It also urges all parties to refrain from incitement to hatred and violence.\n\nThe Council recalls MONUC's mandate to assist the transitional government and authorities in security sector reform and decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
