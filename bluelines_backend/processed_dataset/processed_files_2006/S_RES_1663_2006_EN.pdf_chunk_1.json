Welcoming the Comprehensive Peace Agreement implementation, it urges parties to meet their commitments. \n\nThe Council extends the UNMIS mandate until 24 September 2006 and requests quarterly reports on its implementation. It also requests the Secretary-General to plan for a potential transition of AMIS to a UN operation, with options to be presented by 24 April 2006.\n\nThe Council strongly condemns militia activities, including the Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA) attacks on civilians, and urges UNMIS to utilize its current mandate. It requests recommendations on addressing the LRA problem and encourages Sudanese parties to finalize disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes.\n\nThe Council decides to remain seized of the matter.",
