Approved imports must be marked, registered, and notified to the Committee by the Government of Liberia.\n\nThe Council reiterates UNMIL's importance in assisting the Government, the Committee, and the Panel of Experts, and requests UNMIL to:\n- inspect inventories of exempted weapons and ammunition;\n- report periodically to the Committee on its findings.\n\nThe Council decides to remain seized of the matter.",
