The resolution extends the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) for four months, until 30 September 2006. \n\nThe Council authorizes the reconfiguration of UNMEE's military component, approving the deployment of up to 2,300 troops, including 230 military observers. It demands that the parties fully comply with Resolution 1640 (2005) and cooperate with the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) to resume the demarcation process.\n\nThe resolution stresses the importance of the full demarcation of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea for lasting peace and recalls that both parties have agreed to accept the EEBC's delimitation and demarcation determinations as final and binding.\n\nThe Council demands that the parties provide UNMEE with necessary access, assistance, support, and protection to perform its duties, including assisting the EEBC in the demarcation process. It calls on Member States to provide continued support for UNMEE and contributions to the Trust Fund to support the demarcation process.\n\nThe Secretary-General is requested to keep the Council closely and regularly informed of progress towards the implementation of this resolution. The Council decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
