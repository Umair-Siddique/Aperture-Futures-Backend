  "summary": "The Security Council, reaffirming previous resolutions on the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, stresses its commitment to the peace process and full implementation of the Algiers Agreements. The Council extends the mandate of UNMEE for four months, until 31 January 2007. It demands Eritrea reverse restrictions on UNMEE's movement and operations, and Ethiopia accept the final and binding decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC). The Council regrets the lack of progress on demarcation, calls on both parties to cooperate with the EEBC, and demands they provide UNMEE with necessary access, assistance, support, and protection. The Council intends to review the situation before 30 November 2006 and transform or reconfigure UNMEE if no progress towards demarcation is made by 31 January 2007. It requests the Secretary-General to present updated options for possible changes to UNMEE's mandate. The Council calls on Member States to contribute to the Trust Fund to support demarcation and expresses appreciation for troop-contributing countries.",
