  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on the Sudan, reaffirms its commitment to the country's sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity. It welcomes progress in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and calls for urgent acceleration of this process. The Council also welcomes the full deployment of UNMIS and acknowledges the commitment of troop-contributing countries. \n\nThe Council notes with concern restrictions on UNMIS movements and materiel by the Government of Sudan, which adversely impact its mandate. It expresses grave concern over the recruitment and use of children in conflict, particularly in southern Sudan, and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Darfur. \n\nThe Council extends the mandate of UNMIS until 30 April 2007 and requests the Secretary-General to report every three months on its implementation. It calls on parties to the CPA, Darfur Peace Agreement, and Nâ€™djamena Humanitarian Cease-fire Agreement to respect their commitments and implement them fully without delay. \n\nThe Council determines that the situation in Sudan continues to threaten international peace and security and decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
