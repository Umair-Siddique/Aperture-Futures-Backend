  "summary": "The Security Council, reaffirming resolutions 825 (1993) and 1540 (2004), expresses grave concern at the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) launch of ballistic missiles on 5 July 2006, which jeopardizes peace, stability, and security in the region and beyond. The Council condemns the launches, demands the DPRK suspend all ballistic missile activities and re-establish its pre-existing moratorium on missile launching. It requires all Member States to prevent the transfer of missile-related items, materials, goods, and technology to the DPRK and to prevent the procurement of missiles or missile-related items from the DPRK. The Council urges the DPRK to return to the Six-Party Talks without precondition, abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and return to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. The Council supports the six-party talks, calls for their early resumption, and urges all participants to intensify efforts on the full implementation of the 19 September 2005 Joint Statement. The Council decides to remain seized of the matter.",
