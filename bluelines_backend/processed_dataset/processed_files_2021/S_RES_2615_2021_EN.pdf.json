  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Afghanistan, stresses the UN's role in promoting peace and stability, and reaffirms its commitment to Afghanistan's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity. The Council expresses deep concern over the humanitarian situation, particularly food insecurity, and the disproportionate impact on women, children, and minorities. \n\nIt appreciates the international community's efforts to provide humanitarian assistance since August 15, 2021, and calls on the UN to coordinate such assistance. The Council recalls the Taliban's commitments on humanitarian access, security, human rights, and counter-terrorism.\n\nThe Council determines that the situation in Afghanistan remains a threat to international peace and security and acts under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. \n\nIt decides that humanitarian assistance and activities supporting basic human needs do not violate resolution 2255 (2015), and permits the processing and payment of funds and provision of goods and services necessary for such assistance. \n\nThe Council requests the Emergency Relief Coordinator to brief the Security Council every six months on humanitarian assistance delivery, including information on payments to designated individuals or entities, risk management, and obstacles to assistance.\n\nThe Council calls on all parties to respect human rights, comply with international humanitarian law, and allow full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access. \n\nIt decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
