Recalling resolution 2655 (2022), which mandated the UN Verification Mission in Colombia until 31 October 2023, the Council notes the request from Colombia's Foreign Minister to task the Mission with monitoring sections 1 and 6.2 of the Final Agreement. Having considered the Secretary-General's recommendations, the Council decides the Verification Mission shall monitor implementation of sections 1 and 6.2, in addition to its existing mandate. The Council expresses willingness to continue working with Colombia's Government on the Mission's mandate, based on agreement between the parties.",
