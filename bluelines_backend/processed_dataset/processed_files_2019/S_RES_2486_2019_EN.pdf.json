  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Libya, reaffirms its commitment to the country's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity. It expresses strong support for the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and its Special Representative, Ghassan Salam√©, in facilitating a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned inclusive political process. The Council calls on all parties to work together, refrain from actions undermining the process, and engage in national reconciliation. It expresses grave concern over ongoing hostilities, terrorist and extremist groups' exploitation of the conflict, and the targeting of civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Council urges the full participation of women in democratic transition, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding. It welcomes efforts to prepare for and conduct national and municipal elections and recognises the key role of the Special Representative in setting the constitutional basis for elections. The Council reiterates its call for Libyans to work towards unifying military and economic institutions, establishing unified national security forces, and a unified Central Bank.\n\nThe Council recognises the need for disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration of armed groups and an inclusive, civilian-led security architecture. It welcomes the economic dialogue and UNSMIL's role in support, and calls on Libyan authorities to improve liquidity and address predation. The Council recalls that Libya's oil resources are for the benefit of all Libyans and must remain under the National Oil Corporation's control.\n\nThe Council expresses grave concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation, including living standards and basic services, and the situation faced by migrants, refugees, and internally displaced people. It urges all parties to prevent and respond to sexual violence and calls on Libyan authorities to end impunity for such crimes.
