It endorses the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement signed by Ivorian political forces on 24 January 2003 and calls for its full and immediate implementation. The Council requests all Ivorian forces to work towards establishing a balanced government and a Monitoring Committee to oversee the agreement's implementation.\n\nThe Council expresses gratitude to the Secretary-General for his role in the peace process and requests him to submit recommendations on UN support for the agreement's implementation. It welcomes the deployment of ECOWAS and French forces to contribute to a peaceful solution and authorizes them, under Chapter VII, to take necessary steps to guarantee their security and protect civilians.\n\nThe Council condemns human rights and humanitarian law violations, stresses the need to bring perpetrators to justice, and urges all parties to prevent further violations. It requests ECOWAS and France to report periodically on their mandate implementation and calls on neighboring states to support the peace process by preventing actions that might undermine Côte d'Ivoire's security and territorial integrity. The Council decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
