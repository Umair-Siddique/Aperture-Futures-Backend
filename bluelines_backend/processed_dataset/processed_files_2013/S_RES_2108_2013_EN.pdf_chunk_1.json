  "summary": "Here is a clear and concise summary of the Security Council document:\n\nThe Security Council expresses concern over the tense situation in the Middle East and the need for a comprehensive settlement. It considers the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and reaffirms its previous resolution 1308 (2000).\n\nThe Council stresses that both Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic must abide by the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement and scrupulously observe the ceasefire. It concurs with the Secretary-General's findings that ongoing military activities in the area of separation could escalate tensions and pose a risk to civilians and UN personnel.\n\nThe Council expresses grave concern at violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and calls on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF area of operation. It strongly condemns incidents threatening the safety and security of UN personnel, including the detention of UNDOF peacekeepers and UNTSO observers by armed elements.\n\nThe Council:\n\n1. Calls on parties to implement resolution 338 (1973) immediately.\n2. Stresses the obligation on both parties to respect the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and exercise maximum restraint.\n3. Urges the Syrian armed opposition groups to halt activities that endanger UN peacekeepers.\n4. Calls on all parties to cooperate with UNDOF's operations and ensure its freedom of movement and security.\n5. Stresses the need to enhance UNDOF's safety and security, including considering adjustments to its posture and operations.\n6. Welcomes UNDOF's efforts to implement the zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse.\nThe Security Council:\n \n7. Decides to renew the mandate of UNDOF for a period of six months, until 31 December 2013, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure UNDOF has the required capacity and resources to fulfil its mandate safely and securely;\n\n8.
