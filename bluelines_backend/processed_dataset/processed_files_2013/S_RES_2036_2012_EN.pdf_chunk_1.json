  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling previous resolutions on Somalia, reaffirms its respect for Somalia's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity, and commits to a comprehensive and lasting settlement. The Council reiterates its support for the Djibouti Peace Process, the Transitional Federal Charter, the Kampala Accord, and the Roadmap to End the Transition. \n\nIt stresses the primary responsibility of Transitional Federal Institutions to implement the Roadmap, welcomes progress made, but expresses concern over missed deadlines.
