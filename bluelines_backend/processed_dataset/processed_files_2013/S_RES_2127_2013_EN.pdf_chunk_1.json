  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on the Central African Republic (CAR), reaffirms its commitment to the country's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and unity. It expresses deep concern at the deteriorating security situation, characterized by a breakdown in law and order, absence of the rule of law, and inter-communal tensions. The Council condemns multiple and increasing violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses, particularly by former Seleka and militia groups, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and sexual violence against women and children.\n\nThe Council stresses the need for the international community to respond swiftly to the crisis and welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in the CAR and planning of MISCA. It recalls that the Transitional Authorities have the primary responsibility to protect the civilian population and reiterates that all perpetrators of atrocities must be held accountable, with some acts potentially amounting to crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe Council also expresses concern at the insufficient capacity of police, justice, and corrections institutions to hold perpetrators accountable and condemns all violence targeting ethnic and religious groups and their leaders. It encourages inter-communal and interfaith dialogues to alleviate tensions and stresses the importance of women's full and equal participation in conflict resolution and electoral processes.\n\nThe Council further emphasizes the risk of the situation providing a conducive environment for transnational criminal activity, such as arms trafficking and the use of mercenaries, and expresses grave concern at the threat to peace and security arising from the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons. It also expresses concern about the activity of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the CAR and the worsening humanitarian situation, strongly condemning attacks on UN staff and humanitarian personnel. The Council underscores the importance of respecting the UN guiding principles of humanitarian assistance.\nHere is a concise summary of the Security Council document:\n\nThe Security Council:\n\nUrges all parties to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel, UN personnel, and their assets.",
