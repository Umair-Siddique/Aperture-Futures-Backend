The situation in Somalia continues to threaten international peace and security. Acting under Chapter VII, the Council authorizes Member States of the African Union to maintain AMISOM's deployment until 7 November 2012, to carry out its existing mandate as set out in resolutions 1772 (2007) and 2036 (2012).",
