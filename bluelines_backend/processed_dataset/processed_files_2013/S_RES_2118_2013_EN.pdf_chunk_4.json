A genuine democratic and pluralistic government must be established, allowing all political actors to compete fairly. This government must commit to international human rights standards, judicial independence, accountability, and the rule of law. \n\nThe transitional governing body with full executive powers must be formed on the basis of mutual consent, including government and opposition members. A national dialogue process must be inclusive and meaningful, leading to a review of the constitutional order and free and fair multiparty elections.\n\nWomen must be fully represented in the transition. Safety, stability, and calm must be ensured through a permanent cessation of violence, protection of vulnerable groups, and humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic must be respected. A peaceful dialogue and negotiation must resolve the conflict. All parties must commit to the six-point plan and engage with the Joint Special Envoy.\n\nThe international community will offer significant support for implementing an agreement, including an international assistance presence under a UN mandate if requested, and funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation.\n\nAction Group members will engage with parties, apply joint pressure, and oppose further militarization. They will also emphasize the importance of an effective empowered interlocutor for the government.\nAction Group members urge the opposition to increase cohesion and have effective representative interlocutors to work on the six-point plan and the present communiqu√©;",
