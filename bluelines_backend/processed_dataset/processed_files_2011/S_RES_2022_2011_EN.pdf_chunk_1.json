  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Libya, reaffirms its commitment to the country's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The Council established a United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) for an initial period of three months, which is set to expire. \n\nThe Council welcomes the transitional Government of Libya and stresses its key role in creating conditions for UNSMIL's mandate implementation. \n\nThe Council decides to extend UNSMIL's mandate until 16 March 2012 and looks forward to the Secretary-General's report, including recommendations on UNSMIL's next phase. \n\nThe mandate of UNSMIL will also include assisting Libyan national efforts to address the threats of proliferation of all arms and related materiel, particularly man-portable surface-to-air missiles. \n\nThe Council decides to remain actively seized of the matter.",
