The Council commends the role of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone and welcomes the update from the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone, requesting that the measures be lifted. It also urges states to cooperate with the Special Court for Sierra Leone and INTERPOL to bring Johnny Paul Koroma to justice if he is found to be alive.
