  "summary": "The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Lebanon, adopted Resolution 2236 (2015) on August 21, 2015, extending the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for one year without amendment. The Council reiterated its strong support for Lebanon's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. It reaffirmed its commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and urged all parties to strengthen efforts to implement its provisions without delay. The Council expressed deep concern at violations of resolution 1701 (2006), particularly the January 28, 2015 disruption of the cessation of hostilities, and looked forward to rapid finalization of UNIFIL's investigations. It emphasized the importance of compliance with the prohibition on arms sales and supply, and respect for the Blue Line. The Council condemned attempts to threaten Lebanon's security and stability, and reaffirmed its determination to ensure UNIFIL's mandate is implemented without intimidation. It commended UNIFIL's personnel, expressed appreciation to contributing Member States, and underlined the necessity for UNIFIL to have necessary means and equipment to carry out its mandate. The Council welcomed the Lebanese Armed Forces' role in extending government authority, particularly in southern Lebanon, and the strong international commitment to support them.
