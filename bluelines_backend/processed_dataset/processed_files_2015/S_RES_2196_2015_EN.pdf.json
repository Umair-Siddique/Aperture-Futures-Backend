  "summary": "The Security Council adopted Resolution 2196 (2015) on January 22, 2015, recalling its previous resolutions and statements on the Central African Republic (CAR). The Council reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the CAR. \n\nThe Council emphasized that a sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be CAR-owned, including the political process and restructuring of the CAR security forces. It called on the Transitional Authorities to accelerate the transition process, including an inclusive and comprehensive political dialogue and reconciliation process, and to hold free, fair, transparent, and inclusive presidential and legislative elections by August 2015.\n\nThe Council commended the African-led International Support Mission to the CAR (MISCA), Sangaris, and EUFOR RCA for their work in improving security and noted with concern that security in the CAR remains fragile. It welcomed the European Union's decision to establish a one-year military advice mission (EUMAM-RCA) to reform the CAR Armed Forces (FACA).\n\nThe Council strongly condemned the resurgence of violence in October 2014 in Bangui and continuous cycles of provocations and reprisals by armed groups. It also condemned targeted attacks against the Transitional Authorities, MINUSCA, Sangaris, and EUFOR RCA troops. \n\nThe Council reiterated that all perpetrators of such acts must be held accountable and that some acts may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It expressed grave concern at the findings of the Panel of Experts' final report that armed groups continue to destabilize the CAR and that illicit trade and exploitation of natural resources threaten peace and stability.\n\nThe Council noted with concern the Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA) continued activity in the CAR and its links to other armed groups. It requested that information on EUMAM-RCA be included in the regular reporting of the Secretary-General on MINUSCA.\nThe Security Council:\n\nStresses the urgent need to end impunity in the Central African Republic (CAR) and bring perpetrators of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses to justice, and calls for the implementation of the 7 August 2014 Memorandum of Understanding on Urgent Temporary Measures, which includes the establishment of a national Special Criminal Court.\n\nEmphasizes the risk of the CAR situation providing a conducive environment for transnational criminal activity, such as arms trafficking and mercenary activities.\n\nAcknowledges the contribution of the Council-mandated arms embargo to countering illicit arms transfers and supporting post-conflict peacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration, and security sector reform.\n\nRecalls the need for an inclusive and effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process, as well as repatriation and resettlement of foreign fighters.\n\nRecalls its decision to establish a sanctions regime targeting individuals and entities that undermine peace, stability, or security in the CAR, or engage in human rights abuses or violations.\n\nDetermines that the situation in the CAR continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n\nActing under Chapter VII:\n\n**Arms Embargo**\n\n1.
