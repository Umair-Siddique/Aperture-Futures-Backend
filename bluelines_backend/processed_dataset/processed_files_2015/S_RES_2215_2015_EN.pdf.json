  "summary": "The Security Council adopted Resolution 2215 (2015) on 2 April 2015, recalling previous resolutions on the situation in Liberia and the subregion. The Council commended the Government of Liberia for responding effectively to the Ebola outbreak and welcomed efforts of Member States and multilateral organizations in supporting Liberia. \n\nThe Council endorsed the Secretary-General's recommendation to proceed with the third phase of the drawdown of UNMIL uniformed personnel, authorizing a new military ceiling of 3,590 personnel and a police ceiling of 1,515 personnel by September 2015. \n\nThe Council decided to modify UNMIL's mandate, expecting the Government of Liberia to assume full security responsibilities by 30 June 2016. The Council requested the Secretary-General to streamline UNMIL's activities and consolidate its presence in line with the downsizing and narrowing of the mandate.\n\nThe Council called on the Governments of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire to reinforce cooperation, particularly in the border area, and requested UN entities in both countries to support the authorities. The Council reaffirmed the importance of inter-mission cooperation arrangements as UNMIL and UNOCI downsize. \n\nThe Council decided to remain seized of the matter.",
