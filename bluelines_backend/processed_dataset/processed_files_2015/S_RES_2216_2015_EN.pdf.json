  "summary": "The Security Council adopted Resolution 2216 (2015) on 14 April 2015, recalling previous resolutions and presidential statements on Yemen. The Council noted the letter from the President of Yemen, requesting support from the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the League of Arab States to protect Yemen from Houthi aggression. \n\nThe Council reaffirmed its commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and condemned Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacks. It expressed concern at AQAP's ability to benefit from Yemen's deteriorating situation and reiterated support for the Gulf Cooperation Council's efforts in assisting Yemen's political transition.\n\nThe Council reaffirmed support for President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi's legitimacy and called on all parties to refrain from actions undermining Yemen's unity and sovereignty. It expressed grave alarm at the humanitarian situation's deterioration and emphasized the need for a political solution.\n\nThe Council recalled that denying humanitarian access and depriving civilians of essential objects may constitute a violation of international humanitarian law.

Requests the Secretary-General to report on implementation of this resolution and resolution 2201 (2015) within 10 days and expresses intent to consider designating additional individuals and entities subject to measures imposed by paragraphs 11 and 15 of resolution 2140 (2014) in case of non-implementation.\n\n3.
