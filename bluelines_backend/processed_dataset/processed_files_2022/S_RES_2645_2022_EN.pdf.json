The Council condemned the assassination of President Jovenel Mo√Øse and urged the Government of Haiti to hold perpetrators accountable. \n\nThe Council acknowledged the Secretary-General's recommendation to adjust the mandate and resources of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) to increase its effectiveness in supporting the rule of law, human rights, and engagement between Haitian authorities, civil society, and stakeholders.\n\nThe Council expressed grave concern about high levels of gang violence, kidnappings, homicides, and sexual and gender-based violence, and stressed the need for a comprehensive and urgent response. It urged the Haitian authorities to address the root causes of instability, including through strengthened rule of law, socio-economic measures, and violence reduction programs.\n\nThe Council welcomed the establishment of the Basket Fund for security assistance for Haiti and BINUH's advisory support for the Haitian National Police (HNP). It encouraged BINUH to play a coordination role with regard to external security assistance to Haiti.\n\nThe Council recognized the important role of neighboring countries, regional and subregional organizations, and international partners in supporting Haiti's efforts to overcome the ongoing political stalemate and security situation. It called on the international community to remain committed to Haiti's efforts and to provide support and financing for activities to address Haiti's humanitarian, stabilization, reconstruction, and sustainable development challenges.\n\nThe Council emphasized the primary responsibility of the Government of Haiti to address longstanding drivers of instability and inequality and to engage with other stakeholders to deliver durable solutions to Haiti's challenges. It stressed the need to address the loss of livelihoods, food security and nutrition, health security, displacement of residents, and access to social infrastructure, including those caused by the earthquake and tropical storm that struck Haiti in 2021.\nHere is a clear and concise summary of the Security Council document:\n\nThe Security Council:\n \n1.
